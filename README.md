haskell_road
============

This directory contains code I've written as I've been going through
Kees Doets and Jan van Eijck's book 'The Haskell Road to Logic, Maths
and Programming' (second edition).

Those files are organized by chapter. Please note that my code does not
necessarily correspond to the exercises, or the examples in the book.
Further, I use language constructs of Haskell before the are introduced
in the book, as well as some that are not introduced by the authors at
all.
